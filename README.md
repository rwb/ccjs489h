# Course Description, Goals and Expectations

* Catalog description: designed for students completing their honors thesis.
* My description: this class is the culmination of nearly 2 years of work. In the first semester, we covered a series of topics related to criminological theory, criminal justice policy, and research methods. You also spent time exploring ideas for a possible honors thesis. Then, you all engaged in a research internship or independent study where you engaged in an actual research project. Last semester, we covered several, more advanced research methods topics and you developed a paper to serve as the foundation for your honors thesis project; you also made a brief presentation to the class explaining your research idea and general approach. This semester, you will build directly on the work you did last semester to write the final version of your honors thesis which will be posted to the department's honors thesis archive. You will also make a detailed presentation to the faculty and graduate students of the department in April. After your presentation concludes, you will answer questions about your project from your fellow students as well as from graduate students and faculty who are attending your presentation.
* At the end of this semester, you should have increased proficiency in (1) critical analysis (including the ability to critically analyze the research literature in your research area and the ability to critically analyze the work of your fellow students); (2) data analysis (including the ability to work with research data to draw scientifically valid conclusions); (3) long-form writing (including the ability to organize a research project into appropriate sections and effective use of written prose to make arguments, report results, draw conclusions, and describe strengths and weaknesses of your work); (4) effective presentation (including the ability to deliver a clear presentation with effective oral delivery and use of slides to supplement your discussion); and (5) responding to questions about your work (including the ability to accurately interpret a question and provide an effective answer to a question that someone raises about work you have done).
* Expectations for students: (1) regular class attendance (appropriate documentation for excused absences is required); (2) regular engagement with me outside of class; (3) participation in practice presentations including delivering your own practice presentations and asking critical questions of other students when they do their practice presentations; (4) being prepared each week to discuss your project progress and unresolved issues you are grappling with; and (5) I am specifically asking you to keep your absences to a minimum (the class will only work if we have consistent attendance from all students); if you think you will not be able to attend class regularly, you should not continue in this course.

# Class Grades

* Final grades: I will be using the plus/minus grading system for this course. Each graded item this semester will be on a 100-point scale. At the end of the semester, I will assign letter grades based on the following cutoffs:

| Numeric Grade | Letter Grade | Numeric Grade | Letter Grade | Numeric Grade | Letter Grade |
|----------:|:-------------:|------:|:------:|-------:|:-------:|
| 98+ |  A+ | 93-97 | A |  90-92 |  A- |
| 88-89 |  B+ |  83-87 |  B |  80-82 |  B- |
| 78-79 |  C+ | 73-77 |  C |  70-72 |  C- |
| 68-69 | D+ | 63-67 | D | 60-62 | D- |
| < 60 | F |         |   |       |  |

* Grade components: throughout the semester, I will assign numeric grades which will contribute to your final course grade. The weights for the individual items are:

| Item | % Weight |
|:----------|-------------:|
| Written Honors Thesis | 60% |
| Oral Presentation/Defense | 25% |
| Class Participation | 15% |
| Total Grade | 100% |

## Grading Critieria for Written Honors Thesis

1. Clear research question: Effective introduction to the paper; project's objectives are stated so that the reader knows what they will learn as a result of this study (maximum of 5 points).
2. Review and synthesis of the literature: Describes and integrates the range of literature that is logically connected to the topic being studied. Key terminology is well-defined based on the literature and is clearly described (maximum of 15 points).
3. Explain how your research question addresses a gap in the literature: You should be explain what we will know as a result of your study and how that adds to the literature or moves the field forward in its understanding of your interest area (maximum of 5 points).
4. Data source(s) to be used is clearly explained: Explains the kind of data that were collected, how the data were collected, the unit of analysis (individual persons, states, counties, or studies if you are conducting a meta-analysis), the time period in which the data were collected, the measures used (in general terms), the source of the data, and description of IRB oversight and approval (maximum of 10 points).
5. Data source(s) to be used is justified: Explains why the data that will be used are an appropriate and reasonable base of information for conducting the study. It is also important to describe the strengths and weaknesses of the data set (maximum of 5 points).
6. Clear explanation of how data will be used to address your research question: This information will usually be contained within a "Study Methodology" section where you describe the process you will use to progress from the data to the study conclusions (maximum of 10 points).
7. Key measures are explained in detail: Discussion of survey questions or variables that are captured from administrative data; descriptive information or statistics about those variables is presented. If scales are created, then discussion of individual items and psychometric scale properties are presented (maximum of 10 points).
8. Study results are accurately presented: Complete presentation of analysis results including hypothesis tests, key coeffcients, parameter estimates, or significant patterns in the data. There is an emphasis here on completeness and accuracy of results (maximum of 15 points).
9. Discussion of how results inform and advance the relevant literature: Careful consideration of how the study results inform our understanding of the scientific knowledge pertaining to the problem/question being studied. This involves placing the current study into the context of the research literature. Also points to directions for future research based on the strengths and
weaknesses of the current study (maximum of 10 points).
10. Minimal errors in syntax, and punctuation. Sentences are well written and express complete ideas. Transitions between sections are well executed and thesis is well organized with appropriate section headings. Paragraphs are of modest length. Choose to write in first or third person and stick with the choice throughout the paper. Paper length will depend on the individual circumstances of each project but honors theses are normally at least 20 pages in length (although they may be longer depending on tables, figures, and appendices. Appropriate formatting of citations, references, tables, and figures; we will use the format for the offcial ASC journal, Criminology) (maximum of 15 points).

# Accessibility Accommodations

* I commit to abiding by and implementing any approved accommodations for persons with disabilities.
* It is your responsibility to consult with the Accessibility and Disability Service (ADS) Office which is located in Shoemaker Hall.
* After your consultation, the ADS Office will transmit your approved accommodations to me.
* After I have received your accommodations from the ADS office, you and I must meet to discuss implementation.

# Academic Integrity

If credible evidence of a rule violation materializes, it will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in accordance with the University's Academic Integrity Policy. Please note that an Academic Integrity referral does not mean that you have been found responsible for a violation or that I have concluded you are responsible for a violation. It means that an issue of concern has been noted and that the Office of Student Conduct will examine it. A determination of responsibility will only be reached after the Office of Student Conduct has completed its investigation with appropriate due process; as an instructor, my role in the process is a limited one.

# Winston Award

You are invited to consider submitting an advanced draft of your honors thesis for the Winston Award. The submission deadline is Friday March 27, 2026. You should consult the University Honors College's [information about the award](https://honors.umd.edu/current-students/grants-awards/).

## Lesson 1 - Monday 2/2/26

### Thesis Sections

1. Introduction (#1 in the rubric)
2. Literature Review (can be but doesn't have to be called "Literature Review"; point #2 in the rubric)
3. Current Study (rubric point #3)
4. Data (rubric points #4 and #5)
5. Study Methodology (rubric points #6 and #7)
6. Results (rubric point #8)
7. Discussion and Conclusions (rubric point #9)

### Key features of research

* empirical -- not normative.
* cumulative -- not isolated.
* replicable and reproducible
* clear and transparent steps and procedures
* full recognition of strengths and weaknesses
* based on a synthesis of logic and creativity
* Julian Simon (1978:6-7): "a good idea is the keystone of an empirical study."
* However, good ideas arise from a strong grounding in previous literature.

### Identifying Relevant Literature

* you've already identified a gap in the literature that your project will fill
* now, you're at the phase where you have to organize and fully describe the literature in your area
* first step is to make sure your literature review is up to date
* modern researchers often use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) as a starting point
* alternatives would include looking carefully at journals in the field where related articles are published
* identify an anchoring piece (or pieces) of scholarship in your research area
* look carefully at the reference list and studies cited within that study
* then, identify that study on Google Scholar and search for studies that cite your anchoring study (or studies)
* through this process you will identify a core group of studies that are important for your topic
* but you then should look carefully at the reference lists for each of the core studies and the studies that have cited your core studies
* this will give you an even larger list of studies -- many of which will not be featured in your literature review
* it is your responsibility to continue this process until you have identified the relevant studies in your literature
* deciding whether a study is relevant is a judgment call
* all relevant studies need to be considered in your literature review
* in deciding whether to include a study, you need to ask yourself some questions:
* question 1: would the reader of my study feel like they were misled if I leave this study out?
* question 2: would the reader of my study feel like they are being asked to consider extraneous material if I include this study?
* question 3: is the reader convinced at the end of my literature review that I have truly identified a gap in the literature?

### Synthesizing Literature

* the most basic way to summarize literature is to provide an annotated bibliography
* many researchers will do this as they organize the literature
* so, an annotated bibliography can be a step along the way
* but an annotated bibliography is not a literature review
* there needs to be an organizing framework
* literature reviews can be organized chronologically
* literature reviews can be organized thematically
* literature reviews can be organized methodologically
* literature reviews can be organized theoretically
* but there is *always* some sort of organizing strategy
* and there needs to be critical analysis of the literature
* simply stating research findings is not enough
* critical analysis of the literature leads to the point where you describe the gap your research will fill

### Examples

In addition to the many examples of honors theses posted on the [CCJS Honors Thesis Repository](https://ccjs.umd.edu/undergraduate/independent-research-archive-0), I am listing 3 example studies below that illustrate different ways of weaving findings from prior studies into a literature review.

1. Douglas A. Smith and Raymond Paternoster (1990). Formal processing and future delinquency: deviance amplification as selection artifact. *Law & Society Review*, 24:1109-1132.
2. Charles F. Manski and John V. Pepper (2018). How do right-to-carry laws affect crime rates? Coping with ambiguity using bounded-variation assumptions. *Review of Economics & Statistics*, 100:232-244.
3. Michael T. Light and Ty Miller (2018). Does undocumented immigration increase violent crime? *Criminology*, 56:370-401.
